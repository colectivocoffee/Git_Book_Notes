# Heap

#### What is a Priority Queue?

Priority Queue is an advanced data type \(ADT\) which is a more refined version of a Queue. It dequeues higher-priority items before the lower-priority items. Most programming languages such as Python use Binary heap to implement it.

Python heapq, as stated in the beginning, provides a min-heap implementation.

#### What is a Heap?

A heap has multiple meaning in computer science. Sometimes, it refers to a memory area in a program used for dynamic allocation. However, in this tutorial, we are talking about the Heap Data Structure, which is a complete binary tree. It helps in implementing priority queues \(PQ\), the heapsort, and some graph-based algorithms.

A heap has the following two variants:

* A max-heap, in which the parent is more than or equal to both of its child nodes.
* A min-heap, in which the parent is smaller or equal to the child nodes.

## Two Heaps -- Min Heap & Max Heap

Min Heap to find the smallest element, Max Heap to find the largest element. 

#### 如何知道要用 Two Heaps Pattern?

1. 跟Scheduling Tasks \(排程\)、Priority Queue有關的情況
2. 如果問你有關 Find smallest/larget/median elements in a set 的問題
3. 有些跟Binary Tree有關的問題
