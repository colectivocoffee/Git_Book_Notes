# \[Hard\] Minimum Window Substring

## [\[Hard\] Minimum Window Substring ](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)    \(6064/411\)

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return _the minimum window in `s` which will contain all the characters in `t`_. If there is no such window in `s` that covers all characters in `t`, return _the empty string `""`_.  
Note: that If there is such a window, it is guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in `s`.

Example
