# Binary Search Tree\(BST\)

## BST Time Complexity

先講結論：Balanced BST `O(logN),` skewed BST`O(N)`，因此`O(logN)-O(N)`

For Binary Search tree it has **two Worst case time complexity** i.e _**minimum and maximum**_.

* When the BST is balanced then the minimum worst-case time complexity is considered and that is O\(LogN\)
* When BST is skewed then maximum worst-case time complexity is considered O\(N\).
* Where N is the height of the tree.
