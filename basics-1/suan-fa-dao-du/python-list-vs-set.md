# \[Python\] List vs Set



| **List** | **Set** |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1. Can contain duplicate elements | 1. Elements must be unique |
| 2. Order of elements is important | 2. Order of elements is not important, but it depends on the implementation |
| 3. Elements are accessed using index | 3. Elements themselves are indices |
| 4. The interface used to implement the list is System.Collections.IList | 4. The interface used to implement the set is System.Collections.ISet |
| 5. The list is implemented as a static list \(using array\) and dynamic list \(linked list\) | 5. Sets are implemented as hashset \(hashtable\) and sorted set \(red-black tree-based\) |
