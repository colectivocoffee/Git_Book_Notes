# 準備技巧

Tips:

1. Learn patterns - top k means at least consider a heap. "Find the order of these relationships" - consider topological sort.
2. Solve problems on paper. Leetcode is useful but if you can solve on paper you'll be fine in coderpad
3. Talk out loud a lot. Nobody loses points for thinking.
4. As soon as you understand the question, propose new inputs. for example if your question is [remove invalid parens](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-invalid-parentheses/), suggest one or two inputs and example outputs. This gives you test cases AND shows you're thinking
5. Immediately propose naive solution - eg if you have Range Sum immediately just note "the obvious solution is n^2 runtime without using space, but I think we can do better." Show your work, as professors like to say.
6. Pseudocode a solution ASAP to get interviewer buy in.
7. Once you get to a working solution, go back to your test cases and manually walk through the code. Open a block comment and write line by line the data transformations.
8. The product design interview is HARD. Do a ton of these on paper for anything you can imagine. Online ordering at Walmart, pretend the deli counter at your grocery store needs to scale to your entire state, whatever you see. Just practice.
9. Come up with a script for design interviews. I use the acronym README - requirements, estimations, API, data model, main system, extended system \(extended means load balancing, caching, etc\).
10. Write a spreadsheet for your behavioral interview. You can make one story about three different questions. For example, "I was the lead of this feature" can be about technical challenges, how did you give feedback, how do you prioritize. Just find 4-5 anecdotes that can scale to various possible questions.
11. Buy a whiteboard. Google drawing and bluejeans whiteboard aren't as good.
12. Trello board. Use spaced repetition. I'll add a pic of mine below

Resources:

1. Leetcode premium. Just do it and do a ton of questions and the mock interview tab. Repeating questions is way better than solving 1000 questions and not understanding the patterns. You should be able to see certain words and immediately reach for data structures and algorithms based on the pattern. Just like a musician - skill means focused repetition.
2. P-R-A-M-P: do lots of mock interviews. I did about 10 before my onsite. 7 coding, 3 design.
3. g-r-o-k-k-i-n-g the SD: pay for it, go over it, practice.
