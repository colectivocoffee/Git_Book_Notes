# \[Medium\] Word Break

## Question

[Word Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/)  
Given a **non-empty** string _s_ and a dictionary _wordDict_ containing a list of **non-empty** words, determine if _s_ can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

**Note:**

* The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
* You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

#### Example:

```text
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
             Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
```

```text
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output: false
```

## Thought Process

根據題意，"determine if _s_ can be segmented into..." 代表找DP的可行性，因此可以使用DP求解。
